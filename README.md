# VADR-profiles

General Pipeline
1. Run 1st round of VADR on subset of viral sequences (with original refseqs)
2. Take sequences that passed 1st round of VADR and build profile to capture diversity in viruses that one refseq cannot capture
3. With new profile run 2nd round of VADR on the same subset of viral sequences
